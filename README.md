Here’s a complete `README.md` for your **Image Processor Project** using React + Flask + Strategy Design Pattern:

---

```markdown
# 🖼️ Image Processor App

A modern, full-stack web application that applies advanced image processing filters using the **Strategy Design Pattern**, built with **React** (Vite) frontend and **Flask** backend.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 📤 Upload any image (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- 🎨 Apply filters like:
  - **Blur**
  - **Sharpen**
  - **Edge Detection**
- 🌗 Toggle between Light & Dark Mode
- 📥 Download processed image
- 🎯 Modular architecture (easily add new filters)
- ⚙️ Built with OpenCV and React + Tailwind + Framer Motion

---

## 🧠 Strategy Design Pattern

Each filter is implemented as a **Strategy** class and selected dynamically based on user input. This enables easy addition of new image processing algorithms without modifying core logic.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Backend (Flask)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py                # Starts server on http://127.0.0.1:5000
````

Make sure to add CORS support if needed:

```bash
pip install flask-cors
```

```python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)
```

---

### Frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                  # Starts frontend on http://localhost:3000
```

## ✨ Future Enhancements

* Real-time webcam filters
* Batch processing support
* Upload custom strategy scripts
* AI-powered filters (e.g., super-resolution)
